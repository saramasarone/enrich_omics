Python wrapper for EnrichR and OpenTargets API. Allows for visualisation of pathways enriched and disease associated to a given target or disease

- Get table with enrichment results
- Get plot with enrichment results ans export it

#### OpenTargets
Open Target is currently only supporting the search of a single target

#### Target endpoint
- Convert Entrez to Ensemble if needed (OpenTargets API accepts only Ensemble IDs)
- Get description of the function of the target
- Get diseases associated to a certain target
- Plot diseases associated to a certain target
- Get table drugs associated to a certain target
- Plot the drugs that work for a given target and the diseases associated to it
- Plot the drugs associated to a given target and the trial phase they are currently in

#### Plots
- Export plots in SVG and PNG


#### Drug endpoint
- Get drug description
- Get a table with drug information (year of approval, drug type, toxicity, warnings)
